# Templates, Examples and Problems Of Data Structure and Algorithm
***
# Overview
This project is orgnaized by the following structure
> **src** serve as template records for training
> >**basis** are some basic usage of date structure and algorithm

> >**data_strcuture** are some commonly used data structures

> >**dp** are summaries of dynamic programming


> >**graph** are some simple and classic graph theory algorithms 


> >**greedy** are some classic greedy problems


> >**mathmatics** are mathematics related algorithms


>> **search** are bfs, dfs and meet in middle

>> **strings** are some classic usages of strings

>>> **template.py** have some data structure and algorithm templates



>>> **example.py** have some unit tests of the related templates



>>> **problem.py** have some problems which can be solved by the related 



> **tests** serve as work space during competitions

> > **codeforces** prepared for codeforces, luogu, atcoder, acwing and so on

> > **leetcode** prepared for leetcode only

>>> **template.py** is a template for copy and paste before starting to solve the problem
